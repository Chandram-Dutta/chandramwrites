Hi there,
<br />
<br />
6th April 2023.
<br />
<br />
I am Chandram Dutta, a passionate developer and student currently pursuing
my studies at <a href="https://vit.ac.in/">VIT</a>, India. As a tech
enthusiast, I've always dreamt of building my own personal blog site, but
I was in a bit of a conundrum regarding the ideal tech stack to use.
<br />
<br />
I craved a framework that would not only load quickly, but would also be easy
to modify, cutting-edge, and wouldn't require me to write loads of JavaScript
(because let's be real, who wants to do that?). After much searching, I stumbled
upon <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> - and it was love at first sight.
<br />
<br />
In this blog site, I'll be sharing my technical knowledge, personal thoughts,
and life updates. It'll be my journal, but also a helpful guide for fellow
tech enthusiasts out there. I'm ecstatic to have you here, and I hope you enjoy
reading my musings.
<br />
<br />
Best Regards,
<br />
Chandram Dutta.
